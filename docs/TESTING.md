## Running Functional Tests
`npm run functional:ci` to run all tests, and exit immediately

To develop in watch mode, please run

`npm run functional:local`

For test isolation, please see [Debugging Test Tips](#debugging-tests-tips)
## Running Functional Tests Silently for Continuous Integration
`npm run functional:ci`

## Running E2E Tests

Run a specific E2E component locally (Only Chrome)

`env PROTRACTOR_SPECS='components/dropdown/dropdown.e2e-spec.js' npm run e2e:local`

Isolate your tests then run with the keys in your path.

 `npm run e2e:bs`

One way to update your .zprofile, .bashprofile, .bashrc, or .zshrc, or append the value on the command by setting env, `env BROWSER_STACK_USERNAME=''... #followed by the command`

```sh
export BROWSER_STACK_USERNAME=xxxxxxxxxxxxx
export BROWSER_STACK_ACCESS_KEY=yyyyyyyyyyy
```
#### Run a specific E2E component on BrowserStack

`env PROTRACTOR_SPECS='components/dropdown/dropdown.e2e-spec.js' npm run e2e:local`

#### Run E2E locally on High Contrast Theme (defaults to light theme)

`env ENTERPRISE_THEME='high-contrast' npm run e2e:local`

`env ENTERPRISE_THEME='dark' npm run e2e:local`

`npm run e2e:local`

## Debugging Functional Tests
For test isolation, please see [Debugging Test Tips](#debugging-tests-tips)
- Isolate the test using `fdescribe` or `fit`
- Put a `debugger;` statement in the test code
- Run `npm run functional:local`, wait for karma server to start, and to place tests in watch mode
- Navigate to http://localhost:9876/
- Open Chrome Dev Tools
- Refresh the page, to rerun the tests, the Sources tab should be open, the script should paused on the `debugger;` statement

## Debugging E2E Tests
For test isolation, please see [Debugging Test Tips](#debugging-tests-tips)
- Put a `debugger;` statement at a place in the test/code for example under the `res = await AxeBuilder` command.
- Start the server normally with `node server`
- In another terminal, run the functional test with `env PROTRACTOR_SPECS='kitchen-sink.e2e-spec.js' env ENTERPRISE_THEME='high-contrast' npx -n=--inspect-brk protractor test/protractor.local.conf.js` in watch mode
- In Chrome open `chrome://inspect` in a new tab.
- Click 'Open dedicated DevTools for Node.
- Hit Play on the debugger
- View `res.violations` in the console

## Debugging Tests Tips
If you want like to test a suite, or an individual spec (`it(`) statement append f to either describe, or it, like so, `fdescribe` or `fit`. This works for unit, functional, and E2E tests.

## FAQ

> How come we do so much browser exclusion logic?

Each browser has a different Selenium driver with different capabilities. We plan highlight this difference for manual testing. As browser capabilities get updated, we should revisit tests that don't work. As for the Chrome exclusions, we are only testing visual regression on Chrome. Chrome is the default local functional test browser, and will be responsible for aiding the creation of the baseline images for visual regression testing.

> Why are so many Axe Rules disabled?

This a bit complex as the light theme is not completely WCAG AA... and per component in various states (open/close) may not be WCAG 2AA as well. Additional various rules are at the application level and not suitable for review on this level. Currently, this is a @TODO, we hope to enable rules like "color-contrast" which are critical to various users.

## Problems
 - Visual Regression
     - Maintaining baseline screenshots across different environments is problematic, and not consistent. The same machines need to run comparisons. Different machines can be generated their own screenshots, and compare them to screenshots on other system.
 - Browser driver differences
    - Lack of process to automate a record of differences to to aid reduction of manual testing
    - Lack of process to check automated tests manually
