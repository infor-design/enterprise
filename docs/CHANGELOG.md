([#3147](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/3147))
- `[Validation]` Fixed an issue where calling removeMessage would not remove a manually added error class. ([#3318](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/3318))

## v4.24.0

### v4.24.0 Important Changes

- `[Icons]` Reversed a change in previous versions to make alert icons all have a white background as this caused issues. Concerning alert icons there are now the following `icon-[name]` - which will have transparent background, in Uplift these are linear in style, in soho these are solid in style. We also add a `icon-[name]-alert` for alert icons with a white background. If you need a white background you can use these otherwise we have restored the functionality from the 4.21 version, you might need a white background in calendar icons. Also the pending icon is fixed and now orange. ([#3052](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/3052))
- `[Datagrid]` Changed the way tables are rendered to avoid gaps at the end of the grid and fix the sizes so they work in resize. This is done by using css position: sticky for headers. It has a few consequences. The spaceColumn option which was never completed was removed. The stretchColumn option is still working but is less important now and defaults to no stretch. IE 11 will now no longer support sticky headers because it does not support css position sticky, so it will degrade in functionality. This improves all issues with columns getting out of alignment. ([#2825](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/2825))

- `[Editor]` The Editor now uses the same routine for stripping disallowed tags and attributes from pasted content when it transitions from the Source View to the Preview. This makes it impossible to paste/type HTML tags containing a `style` property with CSS rules that are not allowed to be applied to inline Editor elements, such as `font-family`. ([#2987](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/2987))
