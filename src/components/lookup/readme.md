## Behavior Guidelines

- To distinguish between single and multi-select situations, use checkboxes in multi-select lists.
- The height of a multi-select list can grow up to 3 lines to accommodate multiple entries. After this point, scrolling should be available.
- In some situations (such as when a lookup is used in a filter row in a table), the field height is fixed and cannot expand to show multiple selections. Include a design approach for multi-select dropdowns in this scenario.

## Code Example

### Lookup Markup

The lookup element is a simple text input field. Always include a matching `<label>` for accessibility. To initialize the lookup call the `.lookup()` plugin.

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="product-lookup" class="label">Products</label>
  <input id="product-lookup" data-init="false" class="lookup" name="product-lookup" type="text">
</div>
```

### Lookup Example

The `field` is the field to be returned from the grid. You can also pass reasonable grid options to the lookup (not all features will work by design). TheÂ `selectable` option can be set to either `single` or `multiselect`. This defines the key difference between a single select lookup and a multi select lookup.

```javascript
grid = $('#product-lookup').lookup({
  field: 'productId',
  options: {
    columns: columns,
    dataset: data,
    selectable: 'single', //multiselect or single
    toolbar: {
      results: true,
      rowHeight: false
    }
  }
});
```

## Mobile Enter Key Behavior

Note that you may want to further customize the enter key behavior for mobile devices. In order to do this you can set it via the attributes option that allows you to pass any option.

```js
$('#product-lookup, #product-mask').lookup({
    ....
    },
    attributes: [
    {
        name: 'enterkeyhint',
        value: 'go'
    }
    ]
});
```

Please refer to the [enterkeyhint documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/enterkeyhint) for further details.

## Accessibility

- This is a very complex control and interaction and is not currently accessible to screen readers
- It does work with keyboard however

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift Tab</kbd> moves focus into the field to/from the next focusable item in the tab order
- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> opens the dialog
- <kbd>Esc</kbd> cancels and closes the open dialog
- <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift Tab</kbd> when the dialog is open, tab will move around the items, for example, from the search to the data grid
- <kbd>Down</kbd> and <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> when focus is on the grid in the dialog this moves the focus up and down on the rows
- <kbd>Space</kbd> toggle selection on the current row if multiselect. If single select, the row is selected and inserted
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> if focus is on the grid in the lookup and if single select, the current row will be selected. If multiselect then all the selected rows will be inserted

## Responsive Guidelines

- The dialog stretches to 90% at smaller breakpoints

## Testability

You can add custom id's/automation id's to the Lookup that can be used for scripting using the `attributes` setting. This setting takes either an object or an array for setting multiple values such as an automation-id or other attributes.
For example:

```js
  attributes: { name: 'id', value: args => `background-color` }
```

Setting the id/automation id with a string value:

```js
  attributes: { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'my-unique-id' }
```

Setting the id/automation id with a string value:

```js
  attributes: [{ name: 'id', value: 'my-unique-id' }, { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'my-unique-id' }]
```

When using the attributes setting, the following elements are appended:

- the input field, with `-input`.
- the trigger icon, with `-trigger`.
- the modal component is passed the same `attributes` setting, but all attribute values are suffixed with `-modal`.
- the datagrid component is passed the same `attributes` setting, but all attribute values are suffixed with `-datagrid`.

Additionally, if any of the Lookup's content is manually defined -- such as the Datagrid, inner-Searchfield, or Toolbar, you should label those with automation id's manually.

## Upgrading from 3.X

- `inforLookup` class changed to `lookup`
- Initialization options and API is different
- Use events rather than callbacks
