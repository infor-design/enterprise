## Font family

We have two different versions of IDS designs for the components Soho/Subtle/Classic and Uplift/Vibrant/New.

For: Uplift/Vibrant/New we now use a custom font[Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) `font-family: 'source sans pro', Helvetica, Arial`. We include two font-weights 400, 600 served from google fonts because our design is limited in terms of weights (just normal and bold), for example we dont use italics anywhere in the designs as it is difficult to read. Source Sans Pro supports a lot of languages but not some of these so these are the [fall backs](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/blob/main/src/components/typography/_typography.scss#L8)

To use the custom font enable this font in the components first you need to add this link to the head of your pages.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,600" rel="stylesheet"/>
```

If your application needs to run without an internet connection its also possible to download the font locally and server it from your server see [google-webfonts](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts/source-sans-pro?subsets=greek,latin,vietnamese) for details.

## Usage

### Singular vs. Plural

Aim to use the singular form when referring to a single object and plural when referring to a collection of objects.

For example:

- Navigation (menu) items are in plural form when referring to business objects (Sales Orders or Purchase Orders)
- Headers (page titles, section titles, tab labels) are in plural form when containing a list or collection of objects (parts or orders) and singular form if they display a single business object (a part detail or order detail)
