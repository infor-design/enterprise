## Spark Line Chart Types

- `sparkline-dots-n-peak` - Shows dots for each datapoint and highlights the top value as "peak".
- `sparkline-peak` - Shows a continuous line changing at each datapoint and highlights the top value as "peak".
- `sparkline-medianrange-n-peak` - Shows a continuous line changing at each datapoint and highlights the top value as "peak" and adds a median range display.
- `sparkline-minmax` - Shows a continuous line changing at each datapoint and the min and max value.
- `sparkline` - Shows just the line changing at each datapoint.

## Code Example

This example shows how to invoke a simple single line sparkline. Multiple lines can be shown by passing multiple data points.

```javascript
var singleLine = [{
  data: [25, 20, 55, 28, 41, 30, 50, 22, 16, 27],
  name: 'Inventory'
}];

var twoLines = [{
    data: [25, 20, 55, 28, 41, 30, 50, 27, 24, 27],
    name: 'Inventory'
}, {
    data: [40, 30, 40, 16, 50, 17, 15, 39, 15, 18],
    name: 'Demand'
}];

$('#sparkline-chart-example-1').chart({type: 'sparkline-dots-n-peak', dataset: singleLine});
```

## Accessibility

- Alternate information should be available for the screen reader user.

## Testability

You can add custom id's/automation id's to the sparkline chart that can be used for scripting using the `attributes` data attribute. This data attribute can be either an object or an array for setting multiple values such as an automation-id or other attributes. For example:

Setting the id/automation id with a string value or function. The function will give you the data as a parameter for making things more dynamic.

```js
var singleLine = [{
  data: [25, 20, 55, 28, 41, 30, 50, 22, 16, 27],
  name: 'Inventory',
  attributes: [
    { name: 'id', value: 'sparkline1' },
    { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'automation-id-sparkline1' }
  ]
}];

var twoLines = [{
    data: [25, 20, 55, 28, 41, 30, 50, 27, 24, 27],
    name: 'Inventory',
    attributes: [
      { name: 'id', value: 'sparkline2-inventory' },
      { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'automation-id-sparkline2-inventory' }
    ]
}, {
    data: [40, 30, 40, 16, 50, 17, 15, 39, 15, 18],
    name: 'Demand',
    attributes: [
      { name: 'id', value: 'sparkline2-demand' },
      { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'automation-id-sparkline2-demand' }
    ]
}];
```

Providing the data this will add an ID added to each point with `point-{dataIndex}`, medianrange with `-medianrange` and connected-line with `-connected-line` appended.

## Future

- A datagrid formatter for showing this data in lists

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- None
