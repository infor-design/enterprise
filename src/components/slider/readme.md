## Code Example

### Single-Handle Slider

The slider control provides a clickable and touchable interface that interfaces with a standard HTML input element with a "range" `type` attribute. Because of styling and functionality requirements, we use a stylized shadow widget which implements the range input's behavior and updates in sync with a hidden input element. This allows the input element to be serialized with the DOM like normal. The simplest way to use the slider control is to create markup containing: a `<field>` (for field and responsive form alignment), a `<label>` and an `<input>` element with `type="range"` and a `slider` CSS class. For accessibility and implementation reasons, the `<label>` is required.

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="slider-regular-example">Regular</label>
  <input id="slider-regular-example" name="slider-regular" class="slider" type="range"/>
</div>
```

### Ranged Slider

Example of a slider control that is configured to be a "range", with a lower value and a higher value. This slider also displays the current value for the selected handle inside a tooltip.

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="slider-regular-example">Regular</label>
  <input id="slider-regular-example" name="slider-regular-example" class="slider" type="range" data-tooltip-content='[""]' data-tooltip-persist="true" />
</div>
```

### Extra Ticks & Colors

This example shows how to properly implement a Slider Control with Ticks using HTML5 data attributes for settings.

```html
<label for="slider-quality-example">Ticks &amp; Colors</label>
<input id="slider-quality-example" name="slider-quality-example" class="slider" type="range" min="0" max="5" value="2" step="1" data-ticks='[
  {"value": 0, "description": "Very Poor", "color": "very-poor"},
  {"value": 1, "description": "Poor", "color": "poor"},
  {"value": 2, "description": "Adequate", "color": "adequate"},
  {"value": 3, "description": "Good", "color": "good"},
  {"value": 4, "description": "Very Good", "color": "very-good"},
  {"value": 5, "description": "Superior", "color": "superior"}
]'/>
```

### Stepped Slider Example

This is an example of a slider that can only have values in increments of 10, with a minimum of -150 and a maximum of 150.

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="slider-stepped-example">Stepped</label>
  <input id="slider-stepped-example" name="slider-stepped" class="slider" type="range" step="5" data-ticks='[
    {"value": 0, "description": "Min"},
    {"value": 100, "description": "Max"}
  ]'/>
</div>
```

Another example of a slider where you can set/add `attributes` like id and automation id.

```html
    <div class="field">
      <label for="slider-regular">Regular</label>
      <input id="slider-regular" name="slider-regular" value="10" class="slider" type="range" data-options="{'persistTooltip': false, tooltipContent: [''], attributes: [{ name: 'id', value: 'slider-id-1' }, { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'slider-automation-id-1' }]}"/>
    </div>
```

## Implementation Tips

Only providing the HTML label and input with a `type="range"` attribute and `slider` CSS class are necessary if using the IDS Enterprise Components Suite.

## Accessibility

The Slider is fairly complex to make accessible. But generally this can be accomplished in four steps:

- Make sure the above keyboard shortcuts are used
- Make sure that there is a label which matches both the input and any shadow element inputs and identifies the field and is correctly matched using the label for to the input id.
- Use the following ARIA tags on all slider handles/thumbs (the clickable/touchable part of the slider):
    - `role="slider"`
    - `aria-orientation="horizontal"` or `"vertical"`, to match the control's orientation.
    - `aria-valuemin` - the lowest possible numeric value on the slider.
    - `aria-valuemax` - the highest possible numeric value on the slider.
    - `aria-valuenow` - the current numeric value of the slider. This should dynamically update whenever the handle value is changed.
    - `aria-valuetext` - If there is a word or phrase associated with the current slider value, it should be duplicated in this attribute so it will be read by a screen reader. This should update in sync with `aria-valuenow`.
    - `tabindex` - set to zero if not using focusable HTML elements, or set to -1 if the handle is disabled.
- Conditionally use the following ARIA attributes in some situations:
    - `aria-label` - Use in most cases to describe the purpose of the handle (Is it the only one? Is it the lower-value versus the higher handle)
    - `aria-describedby` - When used in conjunction with a [tooltip control](./tooltip), this attribute will be appended to the handle automatically, but in this case the `aria-label` attribute should be removed.

## Testability

The slider can have custom id's/automation id's that can be used for scripting. To add them, use the option `attributes` to set an id on the generated slider. This can take either an object or an array if doing several id's, and you can configure the automation id name. For example:

```js
  attributes: { name: 'id', value: args => `message-id-${args.id}` }
```

Setting the id/automation id with a string value:

```js
  attributes: { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'my-unique-id' }
```

Setting the id/automation id with a string value:

```js
  attributes: [{ name: 'id', value: 'my-unique-id' }, { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'my-unique-id' }]
```

Providing the data, this will add an ID added to each slider wrapper with `-wrapper`, slider hitarea with `-hitarea`, slider range with `-range`, slider handle with `-handle`, slider ticks and ticks complete with `-tick-{idx}`, and the hidden slider element appended.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard functionality of the slider control differs based on whether or not the slider is single-thumbed (one handle), or a "range" (multi-handle). The keyboard applies to all types of sliders in these ways:

- <kbd>Right</kbd> and <kbd>Up</kbd> arrows increase the value of the slider
- <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrows decrease the value of the slider
- <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> move to the minimum and maximum values of the slider
- <kbd>Tab</kbd> into and out of the slider handle
- <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd> optionally increment or decrement the slider by a given amount Normally it will change by 10% of the total possible value of the slider, or it will adjust to the next highest/lowest tick
- Note: Focus is placed on the slider. (The visual object that the mouse/touch user would move, also known as the thumb.)
- Note: Localization for right-to-left languages may wish to reverse the left and right arrows

In cases of a range (two-handled) slider, the keyboard functionality changes in the following ways:

- On the lower-value handle, <kbd>Right</kbd> and <kbd>Up</kbd> arrows will only increase the value of the slider up to the constraint of the higher-value handle. The lower handle can never be a higher value than the upper handle
- On the higher-value handle, the <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrows  will only decrease the value of the slider down to the constraint of the lower-value handle. The higher handle can never be a lower value than the lower handle
- <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd>  have the same effect of being constrained by other handles
- <kbd>Tab</kbd>  will initially focus on the first handle. Pressing Tab again will focus the next handle Pressing Tab a third time moves to the next focusable object in the document
- <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd>  has the reverse effect

## States and Variations

- Draggable
- Active (vs. at rest)
- Focus
- Hover
- Disabled

Note: Only an entire slider control can be disabled. If the slider is a range (meaning multiple handles), setting the slider control to disabled will cause all handles not to respond to input.

## Responsive Guidelines

- The slider control is responsive, and should automatically stretch to fill 100% width (if horizontal), or 100% height (if vertical) of its parent container.
