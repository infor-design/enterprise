Note that the tags and badges look the same but should not be used interchangeably. A badge is used mainly for alphanumeric values i.e. numbers currency ect. and should not cannot take an icon or text. For text embellishments use a tag. For icons use an icon or status icon or alert icon.

## Code Example

Tags are simple span elements with the class `tag`. They can be mixed in to other elements like lists, grids and multiselect. You can optionally add a few classes to add color or status such as `error` for red, `good` to be green and `alert` for yellow. Since you should not use color alone to indicate state, this should be either supplemented with off-screen labels or visual labels near the element explaining the state.
Tags may also have a close button to remove them or contain a link.

```html
<div class="tag-list">
    <span class="tag hide-focus"><span class="tag-content">#Tagged 1</span></span>
    <span class="tag hide-focus"><span class="tag-content">#Tagged 2</span></span>
    <span class="tag hide-focus"><span class="tag-content">#Tagged 3</span></span>
</div>
```

## Accessibility

- Since you should not use color alone to indicate states, this should be either supplemented with offscreen or visual labels near the element explaining the state

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: If the tab is focusable this will focus or unfocus the tag.
- <kbd>Backspace / Alt+Del</kbd>: If the tag is dismissible then this will remove the tag.
- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: If the tag is clickable then this will follow the tag link.

## States and Variations

- Dismissible
- Linkable / Clickable
- Static

## Responsive Guidelines

- Takes fits within the width of the parent container

## Upgrading from 3.X

- In 3.x badges and tags were used interchangeably. These now have separated usages that should be reconsidered
