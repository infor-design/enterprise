The advanced file upload control just needs a `<div>` with the class `fileupload-advanced` in which to draw its contents.

```html
<div id="fileupload-advanced" class="fileupload-advanced">
</div>
```

This is done by using an HTML5 drag and drop feature, so is only supported well on modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 11 or later.

## Testability

The fileupload-advanced can have custom id's/automation id's that can be used for scripting. To add them use the option `attributes` to set an id on the fileupload-advanced. This can take either an object or an array if doing several id's, and you can configure the automation id name. For example:

```js
  attributes: { name: 'id', value: args => `fileupload-advanced-id-${args.id}` }
```

Setting the id/automation id with a string value:

```js
  attributes: { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'my-unique-id' }
```

Setting the id/automation id with a string value:

```js
  attributes: [{ name: 'id', value: 'my-unique-id' }, { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'my-unique-id' }]
```

The label will get an id with `-label` appended after the id given.
The icon will get an id with `-icon` appended after the id given.

If setting the id/automation id with a function, the id will be a running total of open fileupload-advanced.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Not keyboard friendly at this time. Will need a browse button.

## States and Variations

- Error
- Success / Fail

## Responsive Guidelines

- The `<div>` will size to parent but recommend default size.
