## Important Notes

This is a specific component wrapper for Searchfield components that reside inside of a [toolbar](../toolbar/readme.md). This component uses a subset of the standard Searchfield component's API. See [this page](../searchfield/readme.md) For a complete API documentation.

## Code Example

*NOTE:* Toolbar searchfields can only exist when a searchfield becomes invoked inside of a toolbar element.  The minimum amount of markup for building a toolbar is present in the code sample below.  For more information about how to define and configure the toolbar component, please see the [toolbar API page](../toolbar/readme.md).

```html
<div class="toolbar no-actions-button left-aligned">
    <div class="buttonset">
        <!-- Begin Toolbar Searchfield Component Part -->
        <label for="example-toolbar-searchfield">Example</label>
        <input id="example-toolbar-searchfield" class="searchfield" />
        <!-- End Toolbar Searchfield Component Part -->
    </div>
</div>
```

## Implementation Tips

- A regular [searchfield](../searchfield/readme.md) defined as an input field with a `.searchfield` class will be automatically converted to toolbar searchfield by its parent toolbar element when being invoked

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- <kbd>Shift + Left</kbd> and <kbd>Shift + Up</kbd> or <kbd>Shift + Right</kbd> and <kbd>Shift + Down</kbd> arrows - When focused on a toolbar searchfield, the focused element is wrapped inside of a [toolbar](../toolbar/readme.md) element, which has its own rules that govern navigation with the arrow keys.  These shortcuts help the user navigate a toolbar while leaving movement of the text cursor to be controlled with the arrow keys
- <kbd>Alt + Del</kbd> - On a `clearable` searchfield, pressing this will clear its contents.

## States and Variations

- Disabled
- Enabled
- Focused

### Contextual Colors

There are several scenarios where the background, border, and text color of a toolbar searchfield can change based on how it's used:

- There is an [alternate in-page style](https://latest-enterprise.demo.design.infor.com/components/toolbarsearchfield/example-alternate-style.html) for toolbar searchfields that can be used when content is displayed over a gray background
- [Inside contextual action panels](https://latest-enterprise.demo.design.infor.com/components/toolbarsearchfield/example-inside-contextual-panel.html), the background and border colors change to match the header
- In any example of a [header](../header/readme.md), the toolbar searchfield's background color becomes semi-transparent black, and the text/border change to stand out better on the darker colors defined in the header's background
- Inside of [mastheads](../masthead/readme.md), the toolbar searchfield will change to a dark graphite/slate to match the background color of the masthead

### Size Settings

- `Collapsed` - If the `collapsible` setting is changed to true, toolbar searchfield can become "collapsed" when either de-focusing the searchfield wrapper, or resizing the page.
- `Expanded` - This is the default state for toolbar searchfields when `collapsible` is set to false.  The searchfield will also look like this when focused in either case.

## Responsive Guidelines

- When activating a toolbar searchfield beneath the phone breakpoint size, it will resize to become the full width of the viewport to make the search text easier to read

## Testability

The toolbarsearchfield can have custom id's/automation id's that can be used for scripting. To add them use the option `attributes` to set an id on the toolbarsearchfield. This can take either an object or an array if doing several id's, and you can configure the automation id name. For example:

```js
  attributes: { name: 'id', value: args => `toolbarsearchfield-id-${args.id}` }
```

Setting the id/automation id with a string value:

```js
  attributes: { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'my-unique-id' }
```

Setting the id/automation id with a string value:

```js
  attributes: [{ name: 'id', value: 'my-unique-id' }, { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'my-unique-id' }]
```

The toolbarsearchfield wrapper will get an id with `-wrapper` appended after the id given.

If setting the id/automation id with a function, the id will be a running total of open toolbarsearchfield.
