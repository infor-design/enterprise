The file upload control is based on the standard HTML `<input type="file">`. When the control initializer runs, the file input gets enhanced styling with a icon button and acts similar to other input fields. The file input element can be serialized as normal form element. File upload can also take the `disabled` attribute.

```html
<div class="field">
  <label class="fileupload">
      <span class="audible">Upload a File</span>
      <input type="file" name="file-input" />
  </label>
</div>

<div class="field">
  <label class="fileupload">
      <span class="audible">Upload a File</span>
      <input type="file"  name="file-name-disabled" disabled/>
  </label>
</div>
```

The custom-styled file upload is built by making the standard file upload element hidden since it cannot be styled. The component works by having the `<label>` wrap the input so that clicking  on the label activates the file input. This can pose issues for testing tools or certain layouts.

## Accessibility

- Make sure the input has a matching label which describes what you are uploading

## Testability

The fileupload can have custom id's/automation id's that can be used for scripting. To add them use the option `attributes` to set an id on the fileupload. This can take either an object or an array if doing several id's, and you can configure the automation id name. For example:

```js
  attributes: { name: 'id', value: args => `fileupload-id-${args.id}` }
```

Setting the id/automation id with a string value:

```js
  attributes: { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'my-unique-id' }
```

Setting the id/automation id with a string value:

```js
  attributes: [{ name: 'id', value: 'my-unique-id' }, { name: 'data-automation-id', value: 'my-unique-id' }]
```

The trigger button will get an id with `-btn-trigger` appended after the id given.
The trigger close button will get an id with `-btn-trigger-close` appended after the id given.

If setting the id/automation id with a function, the id will be a running total of open fileupload.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> opens the dialog for selection
- <kbd>Tab</kbd> causes the input to get focus
- <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> reverses the direction of the tab order. Once in the input, a <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> will take the user to the previous focusable element in the tab order

## Upgrading from 3.X

- Replace any calls to `inforFileField()` with `.fileupload()`
- Replace class `inforLabel` with `label`
- Replace class `inforFileField` with `fileupload`
- Make sure the `<label>` wraps the `<input>` element
